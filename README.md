## Development process
First steps were launching my application on heroku and establishing working curl requests, and setting a working route for my token authority(USER). I knew I had to establish a working model/route for a new created resource, in this istance kudos. Kudos will be fed on my front end, into an array, that is randomly iterated through using JS functions on the front end, and read in HTML to the user.
